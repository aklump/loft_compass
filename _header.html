<p>Loft compass extends the blueprint framework providing up to 15 breakpoints (viewports) and grid widths. It simplifies grids and media queries by thinking in terms of devices.</p>

<p>Resize your browser window to see the various viewports.  For best results use a browser, such as Opera, that allows you to reduce your window width to 0px.  You should study the SASS files in this source code to learn this framework.</p>
