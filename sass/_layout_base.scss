//
// The first step is to define the width of design for each device that we
// intend to use.  From henceforth you will use this as "device constants".
// A full list of device constants can be found in loft_compass/_layout.scss.
// Let it be noted, there is nothing magical about these names, they can be
// changed, the master list is only provided for illustration and convention.
// Name these as you see fit.
// 
// You will pass these variables as the device/size argument in these functions:
//   - grid_init()
//   - grid_set_width()
//   - grid_media_min()
//   - grid_media_max()
//   - target_device()
//

$iphone5_l: 568px;
$ipad_p: 768px;
$desktop: 1024px;
$widescreen: 1280px;

//
// In a typical implementation, you will not use all 15 possible breakpoints, so
// the next step is to redefine the as seen below.  There are a few things to 
// bear in mind.
// 
// 1. The first list item for each breakpoint is the min width
// 2. The second list item is the grid width; IT MUST MATCH A VALUE DEFINED
// ABOVE AS A DEVICE DESIGN WIDTH!
// 3. You have to set any breakpoints above those you intend to use with the
// $media_max_top var, as shown.
