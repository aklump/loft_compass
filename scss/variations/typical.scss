// In a typical implementation, you will not use all 15 possible breakpoints.
// Instead you will redefine them like the following.  Notice that you have to
// Set all breakpoints beyond those you will use to the maximum which is $media_max_top.

// Redefine the breakpoints and grid widths
$_breakpoint1:    0 312px; 
$_breakpoint2:    320px 312px;
$_breakpoint3:    480px 474px;

$_breakpoint5:    960px 960px;
$_breakpoint6:    $media_max_top $media_max_top;
$_breakpoint7:    $media_max_top $media_max_top;
$_breakpoint8:    $media_max_top $media_max_top;
$_breakpoint9:    $media_max_top $media_max_top;
$_breakpoint10:   $media_max_top $media_max_top;

// The next step is to define the width of our design for each device that we
// intend to use.  When using the grid aspect, this becomes the outer grid
// width.
// 
// You will pass these variables as the width argument to these functions:
//   - grid_init()
//   - grid_set_width()
//   - grid_media_min()
//   - grid_media_max()

// Define the design widths for the devices we intend to use.
// These numbers should match the grid widths defined in $_breakpoint...
// The values shown below work great with a 10px margin between columns.

// It is only convention that the class takes it's name from the variable list

// 
// Notice in these examples instead of using @media query, we us the 
// target_device mixin.  Compare this to all.scss
